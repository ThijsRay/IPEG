# IPEG
Image Parametric Equation Generator

This repository allows you to create parametric equation for arbitary images. The code itself was shamelessly copied from Wolfram Alpha Blog [1]. I basically stripped out the useless bits, and added a few lines so it spits out Matlab compatible equations. I also added a template, so you can basically copy the output from Mathematica, and paste it into Matlab, and plot the graph.
